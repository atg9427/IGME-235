                    In our IGME-106 class, we had to come up with a game theme that everybody in the class would vote to use for their group projects. After ruling out several concepts, my group, TBD Games, came up with the theme, "Light is dangerous." To our excitement, our idea won the vote and we went to work. TBD Games consisted of myself, Scott, Nikki, and Julian.

                    My group came up with the title "Adumbration," which means "to be in shade," or "in the absence of light." We decided to make our game a top-down puzzle game, where the player controls a being made of shadows that must escape a labyrinth by completing a series of levels (We managed to make two levels). Light hurts the player, so they have to use light beams to solve puzzles without touching the beams.

                    I am very proud of what we did in Adumbration. We even met some of our stretch goals, which included sound effects, music, and shadow-casting. We had originally planned to use a "dash" function to pass through light beams but felt that would make the puzzles too simple. Instead, we implemented a "grab" function and placed mirrors so that the light beams could be redirected by grabbing and moving the mirrors.

                    Adumbration is coded in C#, using MonoGame. We used Penumbras for shadow-casting and Text File IO for level generation.

                    The music and sound was made by Nikki. She also implemented the Penumbras for shadow-casting. The player animation and door functions were made by me.
