    <h1>**Documentation**</h1>
    <p id="doc">
        This project was probably the most difficult to do but the game itself was definitely the most fun to make. I made all of the sprites myself. The only image in this project that is not mine is the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AfterEffects/comments/wp1bbs/made_this_abstract_gif_animation/">background</a>.<br><br>I used the Circle Blaster exercise as a template for my project.
